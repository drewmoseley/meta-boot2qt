2. Installing Boot to Qt on Target Device

To flash the image, you can use either Toradex Easy Installer
(https://developer.toradex.com/software/toradex-easy-installer#) or Qt's Flashing Wizard.
With Toradex Easy Installer, the image is flashed to the device's internal eMMC
flash memory.


2.1 Flashing with Toradex Easy Installer:

When Toradex Easy Installer is connected to the Internet, it automatically provides
the latest Boot to Qt image in its image list but that is not necessarily compatible
with your Boot to Qt installation. When you flash with Toradex Easy Installer,
you should always use the *.tezi.tar package that is included into the Boot to Qt
installation.

Flash the Boot to Qt image with Toradex Easy Installer as follows:

1. If your target device does not have the pre-installed Toradex Easy Installer,
follow instructions in https://developer.toradex.com/software/toradex-easy-installer#load-toradex-easy-installer#
to load Toradex Easy Installer.
2. Your Boot to Qt installation has the *.tezi.tar package under
<Qt installation directory>/<Qt version>/Boot2Qt/<target>/images. Extract the package
to an SD card or a USB flash drive.
3. Flash the image from the SD card or the USB flash drive with Toradex Easy Installer.
See https://developer.toradex.com/software/toradex-easy-installer#installing-the-images.


2.2 Flashing with Qt's Flashing Wizard

Use Flashing Wizard to flash the image to your device:

1. Connect your SD card reader to the development host. Make sure that the SD card size is at least 4 GB.
2. Launch Qt Creator.
3. Select Tools > Flash Boot to Qt Device, and follow the instructions in Flashing Wizard.

In order to boot from the external SD card, U-Boot needs to be updated.


2.3 Booting from External SD Card

Connect a serial cable to the device and enter into the U-Boot environment by
pressing any key before the autoboot.

Enter following commands into U-Boot:

run setupdate
run update

Reset or power cycle the device to start the new U-Boot.
To reset the U-Boot environment to new default values, enter the following commands in the U-Boot command line:

env default -a
saveenv

New U-Boot commands are now stored into the device.
